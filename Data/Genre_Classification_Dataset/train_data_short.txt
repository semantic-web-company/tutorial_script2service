Kordic describes the language of Croats, Serbs, Bosniaks and Montenegrins as a pluricentric language, with four standard variants spoken in Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

This fact suggests by no means a re-establishment of a common state, since standard variants of all other polycentric languages are spoken in different countries, e.g. English in the USA, UK, Australia, and Canada, German in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland.

Moore, a Flint native, wrote and directed the documentary Roger and Me about the darker side of capitalism and General Motors. Omar McGee, another Flint native, picks up where Moore left off with Flint Town Kids, a documentary showing the African American dark side of Flint. Flint is predominantly populated by African Americans who migrated from the south after Reconstruction. Flint can be viewed as a microcosm of America's poverty stricken urban areas. Once abandoned by General Motors, Flint became one of the poorest urban areas in the country. Flint Town Kids captures the bleak setting in which these Flint natives exist. It powerfully examines the hardships, the sufferings, mishaps and sacrifices made in order to persist in this town.

On the other hand, students who are non basketball players are left with mediocre excuses for classrooms while adjusting to the lack of libraries needed to empower young minds.

For those who are not as fortunate to escape the nightmarish lifestyle that Flint brings, they embark on survival methods such as drugs and violence. Flint Town Kids brings to light the little faith left in the system. Children raising kids and kids age ten killing each other is just an everyday part of life in Flint. The documentary will depict those shocking scenes in the lives of children who are left with no choice but to make adult decisions in a world where only the fittest survive. For many adults the consuming goal of overcoming poverty lies in making cocaine. Flint Town Kids graphically explores this process which seems to have become the saving grace for many in a town that presents scarce positive outcomes for the future. Flint Town Kids will leave audiences outraged and enthralled with the African American lifestyle in an area that once presented promise only miles from the Motor City. Follow-up to Dollar Bill Y'All. Story revolves around the youth on the streets of Flint, Michigan and the choices they face. Several Flintown Kids grow up to be ballers, jumping right from high school to the NBA while others are faced to find other ways off the streets, like selling drugs and resorting to violence.

448 | Guidance Is Internal (2016) | short | Two people find themselves on the precipice of romance. Their personal convergence parallels NASA's exploration of space and echoes of JFK's once and future dream. Specifically the Apollo 11 voyage to the moon and JFK's 1962 speech ennobling cosmic quests are entwined with our characters' encounter. The micro and macro of human life are showcased through cross-cutting techniques. Both narratives underscore our film's essential theme; that love is the essence of all exploration and it is indeed the greatest adventure of all. Space exploration of all scales is born out of our internal need to connect externally. The title, "Guidance is Internal", was originally uttered during the Apollo 11 launch countdown and serves as a thematic bridge between the two stories. On one hand, we have two characters whose internal desire to connect catalyzes their external actions to communicate. On the other hand, we have the culminating efforts of humanity literally reaching for the stars in hopes of better understanding our place in the universe. Ultimately, what does each existential excursion into the unknown grant us? An understanding that we are not alone. For our two characters, their connection is forged by a mutual understanding and feeling for life. For the human race, witnessing our planet from the heavens imbues in us with an understanding of our innate interconnectivity. In both cases, a greater harmony is achieved. This is the story of two potential lovers (Collin Varney and Sondra Glass) on a journey to connect, interwoven with the Apollo 11 Moon landing and JFK's rousing 1962 speech at Rice University. The over-arching theme of our interconnectivity through exploration and our subsequent place in the universe is personified through these duel narratives.
449 | NorTec (2001) | documentary | At the dawn of the twenty-first century, the Nor-tec phenomenon emerged from the border city of Tijuana and through the Internet, quickly conquered a global audience. Marketed as a kind of "ethnic" electronic dance music, Nor-tec samples sounds of traditional music from the north of Mexico, and transforms them through computer technology used in European and American techno music and electronica. Tijuana has media links to both Mexico and the United States, with peoples, currencies, and cultural goods--perhaps especially music--from both sides circulating intensely within the city. Older residents and their more mobile, cosmopolitan-minded children thus engage in a constant struggle with identity and nationality, appropriation and authenticity. Nor-tec music in its very composition encapsulates this city's struggle, resonating with issues felt on the global level, while holding vastly different meanings to the variety of communities that embrace it. With an impressive hybrid of musicology, ethnomusicology, cultural and performance studies, urbanism, and border studies, this documentary explores all facets.

622 | Lady Man (1976) | short | The symbolic caress. The argument is the erotic power of a choreography with three people: camera, colour, and above all, bust.

Editing functions with formal analogies contained by shots, without any consequence. It is a gathering of moduls reconstituted in a whole thing by the linearity of the movie. In this one, the body's desire is always present, expressed by the language of images. Concerning the topic, it is this body, space to film, sacralised by visual interventions and exploration of camera. The projection on big screen produces a body-landscape or an androgynous body of which some parts remain undecipherable. Track of colours on epiderms is a personnal tribute to "living paintbrushs" used by Yves Klein for his "Anthropometries" (1960).

698 | From Orphan to King (2005) | documentary | For fifteen million years orangutans roamed tropical forests from China to South East Asia. In Borneo, one of their last island outposts, lives one today who is a legend. He's won more than just a kingdom, he's won human hearts. They gave him the name Kusasi. The Orangutan King is the story of Kusasi's life told to us by a remarkable witness. Dr Birute M. Galdikas has been researching orangutans in Borneo for over 40 years. Under the guidance of Louis Leakey, Galdikas joined Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey to become a pioneer of Great Ape field research. Together they were known as the 'trimates', or 'Leakey's Angels'. Yet while Goodall's chimpanzees and Fossey's gorillas were made familiar through films, the orangutans are still largely unknown to television audiences. Their solitary lives high in the tree canopy have made them difficult to follow and film. Now, for the first time, Dr Galdikas will draw audiences deep into the orangutan universe. With enthusiasm and insight she tells us this special story - taking us back 30 years and unfolding Kusasi's story with detail, energy, and the wonder that she still feels for the orangutan species. As a three year old orphan, Kusasi fell under the care of Galdikas in her forest research camp. But driven by a cunning and tenacious spirit Kusasi did not behave as the other ex-captive infants. From the moment he arrived until today, Galdikas has watched Kusasi fight to win back and then succeed at life in the wild. And he's achieved what had once seemed impossible, reaching the top of the power hierarchy and ruling for ten years. The people who work at Camp Leakey enjoy his charisma, and even those who only visit him in his forest kingdom are struck with awe. As Julia Roberts was in 1997. Her encounter with Kusasi was unplanned - becoming a tight clinch with an irritable 140 kilo beast, possessing the strength of ten men. But she was unharmed. Kusasi is not malicious, and he's respected as much for his indifference to humans as for his power over the other orangutans. Today his spirit still burns brightly but his physical strength is fading. His fights with the rogue males who cross his borders are weakening him and The Orangutan King is the last chance for us to see him in power. But the hope of this film is that he will not be the last of his kind to rule with such strength in his forests. If the forest destruction can be stopped, there is a long future for the considerable Kusasi bloodline.

Memoirs of a Medium looks at the current spiritual revolution from the perspective of the people involved.

Sean was just like any child growing up in the seventies, coming from a large family in a small house in Sligo. He spent his days exploring the countryside with his identical twin brother Liam. All seemed well by day, however by night Sean was being visited by strange visitors, people from the distant past. Petrified by fear, Sean told others of his experiences, but they fell on deaf ears. With nowhere to turn, not even his twin brother, he began to feel isolated and decided to not speak of it. Only when he meets Asha, his spiritual mother, does he discover his true calling, spiritual medium-ship. With change however, came resistance, from both his inner self and also the people around him.

They tell of the benefits certain people gain from medium-ship. Shot on location in Ireland, Memoirs of a Medium reveals this new spiritual revolution.

803 | Arctic Window (1985) | documentary | Filmed in the heart of Chicago, across the uninhabited Icelandic interior, and on the sea cliffs of volcanic Heimaey Island, the program provides a window to two lands and its people; one urban and American, the other, wild, wondrous, and inhabited by modern-day descendants of ancient Vikings, and to a delightful little bird that most of us would never get a chance to see. The film begins by tracking the expedition of the project's lead zoologist across the entire length of Iceland, taking in an amazing landscape of waterfalls, glaciers, hot springs and geysers and spending a day with a rural Icelandic family living on the country's north coast, only a few miles from the Arctic Circle. He then travels by ship to the only inhabited island in the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago, located off of Iceland's south coast. Here, the zoologist is joined by a handful of colleagues, who set to work on the steep coastal bluffs to humanely capture and crate for air transport to the U.S. several dozen newly-born, downy puffins. The film then shifts to Chicago, where the birds are held in quarantine at a remote site while the final touches are being put on the new building and seabird habitat they will live in. Here we join the building's architect and engineer as they guide us through the unique design, construction, and layers of complex technology and machinery required to create in terrain, temperature, and lighting of an exacting replica of Iceland ideal for the North Atlantic puffin, but located in the heart of Chicago's cityscape. Finally, the film records the puffins' arrival, veterinary examinations, and climatic entry into their new home that, for nearly 4 million zoo visitors per year -- and on a busy day, more than 200 busloads of city school children -- will provide a "window to a world" they've only heard of or read about in textbooks.
